// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

the sum of 2 and 3
2+3=5
print

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(even is if a number is divisible by 2, odd isn't)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(1 2 3 4 5
to find the average of those numbers, add them all up and divide by 5. average is 3
the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 5)
